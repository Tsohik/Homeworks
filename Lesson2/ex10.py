The input consists of three positive integers - the salaries of the employees. Output a single number, the difference between the top and the bottom salaries

salary1=500
salary2=100
salary3=1000
max_salary= max(salary1,salary2,salary3)
min_salary= min(salary1,salary2,salary3)

salary1=11
salary2=36
salary3=20
max_salary= max(salary1,salary2,salary3)
